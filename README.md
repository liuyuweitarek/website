> Due to issues with the forked project's GitHub Action workflow, I have migrated my personal website to a [new repository](https://github.com/liuyuweitarek/liuyuweitarek.github.io). See more details in the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26704).


# Personal Website

This repository contains source code of the Tarek's personal website, which is built based on [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This website originally comes from [Paweł Kosiec's awesome personal website](https://github.com/pkosiec/website). You can read more details in Paweł Kosiec's README. Appreciate his kind sharing and contribution!

    - On local machine

### Local Development

Run following command in the terminal, based on the environment you choose, local machine or container:

```
$ npm start

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
